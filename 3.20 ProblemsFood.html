                <li>My husband and I are both very worried about our daughter who is now 15 years old. She seldom eats healthy foods like broccoli or carrots, apples or oranges. Instead, she usually eats unhealthy foods like hamburgers and French fries, cookies and candy. I think her school cafeteria should offer healthier food, and TV commercials should advertise better food. How can we get our daughter to change her eating habits?</li>
                <hr>
                <li>Help! I’m a university student living away from my family and home for the first time. I have to pay a lot of money for things like tuition costs and books and transportation and rent. Yesterday, I went to the supermarket and I was so surprised by how much everything costs. The frozen pizza I bought costs fifteen dollars! Can you live me any advice on how I can spend less money on food?</li>
                <hr>
                <li>I would really be very thankful for any advice you can give me. Our young son, who is 5 years old, is very active. He loves to run and play outside with his friends, watch TV, and read books. The problem is this: our doctor says that he is too skinny and he should eat more.

                However, I try to give him lots of food to eat, but he just doesn’t eat very much. He eats just a little, and then he runs away to watch his favorite cartoon or play with his friends. My friend says I should let him eat things like hot dogs and ice cream to get him more interested in eating. But I want our son to eat lots of fruits and vegetables</li>
